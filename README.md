# SubCounter for Scriptable
A Terminal-like Widget for Scriptable iOS made with SubStats v2 API
SubCounter is a custom widget written in JavaScript forked from [TermiWidget](https://gist.github.com/spencerwooo/7955aefc4ffa5bc8ae7c83d85d05e7a4) using [SubStats v2 API](https://github.com/spencerwooo/substats) as the power source. (All credits from both of those works goes to [@SpencerWooo](https://github.com/spencerwooo))
In order to use SubCounter you need to:
- Install [Scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/scriptable/id1405459188) on your device runing iOS or iPadOS
- Create a New Script via + button in Scriptable app
- Copy and Paste all the codes in [This Gist](https://gist.github.com/amirsaam/e531b5f1662fa8bdd8a024eefa06a728) to the New Script.
